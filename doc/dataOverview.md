# Kras IPSC data overview

Follow up from seperate meeting with Prof and Roman on 6/9/2020

Data sets we want to focus on as prep for meeting with Kevin are

Prof's directions:
a) The 3 IPSC scrambled exo rna libs

    - they are the extra cellular rna libs
    - sequenced rna from the dish not the cells
    - they are the control
    
b) the 3 ipsc kras exo rna libs

    - they are extra cellular rna libs from the treatment. i.e. down regulated kras
    - sequenced rna from dish not the cells

Run desq to identify non biologic effect we need to control. E.G. any thing that is over or under expressed is probably due to experimental condition and not biology


## Make sure we know what data files to use
Roman mentioned that these where some of the first files he ran through his pipe line. 

"The only comparisons I am 110% on those we are submitting in the current manuscript. I have code that will run the in vitro comparisons no problem but I am currently writing a new script to handle the patient data and include metadata into the model. You can find my in vitro DESeq script @ /public/groups/kimlab/exoRNA-biomarkers-panc/scripts/tximport.and.normalize.R. R scripts are run with the ```Rscript``` command and behave like any other *nix script after that, it has argparse so you should be able to see whatâ€™s going on. "


```

```

The raw data files

```
(base) [aedavids@courtyard ~]$ ll $d/exo.data/bam.files
total 4.5G

```

### The "control libs

```
(base) [aedavids@courtyard ~]$ ls $d/exo.data/*ctrl*

# 1. the "type a" files
/public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/exo.data/ctrl.de.seq.csv*


# 2. same data set as 1. used the desq normalized counts algo
/public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/exo.data/ctrl.normalized.counts.csv*

# 3. same data as 1. just aligned to ???? reference includes transposible elements
/public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/exo.data/ctrl.te.exo.comp.de.seq.csv*

# 4. same data as 3. used the desq normalized counts algo
/public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/exo.data/ctrl.te.exo.comp.normalized.counts.csv*
```


### The treatment libs

```
(base) [aedavids@courtyard ~]$ ls $d/exo.data/*kras*

# 5. the "type b" files
/public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/exo.data/kras.de.seq.csv*

# 6. same data as 5. used desq normalized count algo
/public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/exo.data/kras.normalized.counts.csv*

# 7. same data as 5. aligned to ??? reference taht includes transposable elements
/public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/exo.data/kras.te.exo.comp.de.seq.csv*

# 8. same as 7. used desq normalized counts algo
/public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/exo.data/kras.te.exo.comp.normalized.counts.csv*
```


## Mastering DESQ2
Find a small set of files we can really dig into, improve the volcano plots
- label kras
- add color gradient to encode abundance info

Roman suggested using the 

```
public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/day.5.de.seq.csv(base) [aedavids@courtyard ~]$ ll $d/day.{5,7}.de.seq.csv
# rna from the ipsc cells.
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rreggiar kimlab 2.2M Oct 30  2019 /public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/day.5.de.seq.csv*
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rreggiar giuser 2.3M Oct 29  2019 /public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/day.7.de.seq.csv*
```

avoid they do not look correct

```
(base) [aedavids@courtyard ~]$ ll $d/day.{5,7}.de.seq.norm.counts.csv
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rreggiar kimlab 3.6M Oct 30  2019 /public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/day.5.de.seq.norm.counts.csv*
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rreggiar kimlab 3.7M Oct 29  2019 /public/groups/kimlab/kras.ipsc/day.7.de.seq.norm.counts.csv*
```
