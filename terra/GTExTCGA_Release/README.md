we have samlom counts 

Counts: Salmon also provides the estimated number of reads (or fragments, in the case of paired-end RNA-seq) that are mapped to each transcript. This raw count data is crucial for differential expression analysis, especially when using downstream tools like DESeq2 or edgeR, which require raw counts as input and perform their own normalization and analysis.
