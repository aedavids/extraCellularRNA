The basis of our previous biomarker selection algorithms was to select the top N differential express genes with abs(lfc) >=2, padj <= 0.001, sorted by baseMean. This selects biomarkers that have the strongest 'signal'. These biomarkers may not be teh most sepearable feature. This notebook explores an alternative algorithm that selects signifignat genes with the best lfc
